# Slides for PVMD workshop

[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

These materials are collected for a workshop on reproducible research software for the [PVMD group at the TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/electrical-sustainable-energy/photovoltaic-materials-and-devices).

## What will you do in this workshop?

- We want to teach you **good habits** that will make your work more accessible, thrustworthy, and reproducible by others. 
- We want to discuss and review the current practices in your group
- Try to adopt some best practices in your own code
- Ask questions, so we can look into the issues you are currently facing

>Disclaimer: this workshop should be seen as an appetizer. Many of the topics would warrant separate 3 hour workshops.
