These materials were originally collected for a workshop on reproducible research software for the [PVMD group at the TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/electrical-sustainable-energy/photovoltaic-materials-and-devices). Please find the original repository [here](https://github.com/mwakok/PVMD-workshop).
